The Matlab files in this repository solve the OLG models in my paper (http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13547860.2023.2210902).
You need VFI toolkit (https://www.vfitoolkit.com) that utilises GPU.

JAPE_olg_pension.m is the main file for solving the model under the benchmark scenario assuming the public pension system.
JAPE_olg_BI_incometax.m solves the model under an alternative scenario that increases the income tax rate to finance basic income program.
JAPE_olg_BI_consumptiontax.m solves the model under the other scenario that increases the concumption tax rate to finance basic income program.
